What follows is a  table detailing the features and the expected version of the easypaysy protocol they will be activated.

It is possible that some of the features (like the Ubercompressed format) never get final approval, but this is the best estimate we have for now.

| ID    | Feature           | Notes                            | version 1 | version 2 | version 3 | version 4 |

| epf003| Type_2 payments   | SPV payments                     |     x     |	         |           |           |

| epf005| Uber compression  | OP_RETURN pubkey torma           |           |	   x     |           |           |
